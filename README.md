# Fisikoin

Introducing a revolutionary physical cryptocurrency, utilizing the security of the blockchain. It is a physical coin with the history of every transaction written into a physical blockchain as well, called Binder. 

# Security

The security of the chain depends on Binder being hidden physically and being well taken care of. Do not expose Binder to the elements. 

# Proof of Work

Proof of work is done by the witnessing of the coin being created by every owner of a Fisikoin.

# Value 

The value of each coin is entirely dependent upon the time taken to create the coin and the material used.
